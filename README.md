# Project-DataScience-Analisis-Pokemon-dsf

Data analysis is a systematic process of deciphering, interpreting, and processing data in order to draw valuable conclusions. I used Pokemon data consisting of 800 Pokemon and the data had 800 columns and 13 rows. I'm using the dataset from this link : https://bit.ly/data-pokemon-dsf.

I use Pokemon data which contains the columns Name, type, Total, HP, Attack, Defense, sp. attack, sp. defense, speed, generation, and legendary or not.

The Pokemon analysis gives us information from various Pokemon. My analysis is based on Pokemon datasets that are in games and movies.

## Goals :
1. Analyze the Percentage of the number of types
2. Analyze the top 5 Types
3. Analyze the Pokemon Generation Percentage
4. Analyze the Legendary Pokemon Percentage
5. Find out the best Pokemon information based on data

## Insights :
1. Comparison of Statistics by Generation
2. Best Pokemon Identification
3. Number of Types Comparison
